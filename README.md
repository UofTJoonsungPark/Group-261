## Introduction ##

Welcome to TimeForge, a versatile productivity application designed to enhance personal task management and collaborative 
planning. This README provides a comprehensive guide on the project, including its motivation, features, installation 
instructions, and usage guidelines.



## Project Description ##

TimeForge addresses the challenge of time management by offering a robust solution for organizing tasks, setting deadlines, 
and efficiently allocating time for personal and professional responsibilities. The primary features include:  

🚀 Personal to-do list and calendar  

🚀 Scheduling tasks and events. 

🚀 Reward system to motivate users through encouraging messages (and eventually) prizes  

The application's goal is to streamline users' daily routines, facilitate coordination among users, and provide a gamified 
element to boost motivation and engagement.



## Features ##

🎯Task Management: Our application provides a robust task management system, allowing users to create and manage 
personal to-do lists with ease. Users can set deadlines, track progress, and efficiently organize their tasks for 
improved productivity.  

🎯Calendar: Stay organized by utilizing our integrated calendar system. Schedule tasks, events, and collaborative plans 
effortlessly. The calendar feature facilitates coordination among users, making it simple to plan and manage various 
activities.  

🎯Reward System: Boost your motivation and celebrate achievements with our built-in reward system! Users are applauded 
for completing tasks, and rewards can take the form of unlockable prizes or uplifting messages. The reward system adds a 
positive reinforcement element to task management.  

🎯Game (Future Plan): In the future, we have exciting plans to introduce gamification to the application. Users will be 
able to personalize characters that embark on unique adventures. As users complete tasks and achieve milestones, their 
in-app characters will progress, adding a fun and engaging element to the productivity journey. Whether it's for work, 
study, or leisure, the gamification feature aims to make task completion a rewarding and enjoyable experience.

We are committed to continuously enhancing our application, and the gamification feature is one of the exciting 
developments on our roadmap. Stay tuned for future updates that will bring even more interactive and enjoyable elements 
to your productivity experience.
